      "content": "ETtech's recent earnings reports show **Infos Edge's** üíº strategic investment in Eternal, the parent company of Zomato and Blinkit, continuing to pay off handsomely! With each Eternal share hitting fresh highs, Info Edge's stake value has surged to a whopping **37,226 crore**, which is now **over a third of its entire market cap**!!!\n\n---\n\nThe recent earnings-fuelled rally in Eternal üîù shares has seen their value **soar nearly 15%** to an all-time high of Rs 311.60. This has caused a positive ripple effect for Info Edge, whose share price gained **4.4%** intraday.\n\nDespite this recent boost, Info Edge shares are still down circa -16% this year. But let's remember, this investment in Eternal, which began way back in 2010, has been a major **seed bet win** for the company. And with Eternal's strong revenue growth, it's a reminder of the power of their portfolio.\n\n---\n\nEternal's latest **Q1 report** shows a picture of soaring revenue, up 70% YoY to a huge Rs 7,167 crore! üí∞ Although net profit fell sharply by -90% YoY, this was anticipated due to investments in key growth areas. The company remains bullish, with CFO Akshant Goyal explaining the decline in profitability as a planned expense.\n\nWith Info Edge holding steady at around 12.38% stake, Eternal's success significantly impacts their overall valuation. And with brokerages now setting price targets at Rs 400, there's potential for even more upside üöÄ.\n\nAre you guys in on this? üíº Capital gains incoming!!!\n\n#IPOchasers #Zomato",

Sharpe ratio calculation needed before any celebratory pronouncements.  Current market sentiment heavily influences valuation;  what's the sensitivity of Info Edge's share price to changes in Eternal's performance?",
